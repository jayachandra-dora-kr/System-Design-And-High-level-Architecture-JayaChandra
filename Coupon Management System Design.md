Coupon Management System: System Design
I was asked to design a Coupon Management System for XYZ e-commerce website where 10k new coupons are released into the system by employees of company every day and 1M users are trying to get hold of coupon, so that they can buy something on the website. These are the constraints:

1. One user can get only one coupon per day
2. One coupon can only be allocated to a single user at any given time
3. Once a user gets a coupon he/she has to buy something on the website within 5 mins.

## Functional Requirements:

Generate valid coupons
Users can only get one coupon per day

## Non-Functional Requirements:

- Low Latency
- High Availability

### Estimation:

- Read heavy traffic
- Traffic
  - 1 million requests per to get coupons per day
  - 10k coupons generated by employees each day
- Storage
  - If we store coupon data for a yearâ€™s time:
  - 10k coupons * 365 = 3.65M objects
  - If each object is roughly of size 100bytes
  - Total storage req: 100 * 3.65M = 365 MB/year
